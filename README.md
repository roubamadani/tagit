TagIt is a web application we developed to view metadata across various file types, 
including images, videos, PDFs, PowerPoint presentations, and Word documents. In 
addition to viewing, TagIt also enables users to edit the metadata of images, PDFs, 
PowerPoint files, and Word documents, providing a simple and unified platform for 
managing file information.
